# Superhero-Gen

In this project, our group of developers have been working to create a user-friendly webpage for comic book fans to search for their favorite superheroes. In particular, the UI is designed to yield search results for their heroes, along with a collection of their corresponding images. This process was accomplished by utilizing two server-side API's (Wikipedia and Giphy) for the search results, along with the Materialize CSS framework for webpage presentation!
