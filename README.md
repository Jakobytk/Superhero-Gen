# Superhero-Gen

## Description
In this project, our group of developers have been working to create a user-friendly webpage for comic book fans to search for their favorite superheroes. In particular, the UI is designed to yield search results for their heroes, along with a collection of their corresponding images. This process was accomplished by utilizing two server-side API's (Wikipedia and Giphy) for the search results, along with the Materialize CSS framework for webpage presentation!

The user will also find as they navigate through each search area it will change the theme of the page to match the genre of character they have searched. It can be reset by clicking on the title of the page.
